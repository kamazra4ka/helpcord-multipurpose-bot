## Introduction
I always wanted to have some sort of a Discord bot with all the "essential" functions that I might need. Before, you always needed to add a bunch of bots just to have access to even simple functionality. This bot gathers all the tools for Entertainment, Moderation, Server management, and more into a single solution, while giving you access to change its branding (color scheme, images) for your server needs.
